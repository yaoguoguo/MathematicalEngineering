# Mathematical Engineering
> Only for Ming Shan.

## Introduction
Mingshan's private git repository is used for code exercises and record mathematical engineering. The infrastructure of the git repository is still being improved, so stay tuned.

## Install
You can directly use the following command to clone the git repository for local use. (The private library needs to ensure that it has the corresponding permissions, you can contact YaoGuoGuo to obtain it)

````
git clone git@github.com:yaoguoguo/MathematicalEngineering.git
````

## How to use git
[git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development.

So making good use of git is especially important. I highly recommend that you practice git on this website, learn the basic operations of git, and understand the operation of distributed warehouses: https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=zh_CN

If you are ready, you can also develop your own branch in the warehouse to practice, but do not force push against the master branch.
